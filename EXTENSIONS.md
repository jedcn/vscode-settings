# Packages

I use the following packages:

* ESLint: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint
* Rewrap: https://github.com/stkb/Rewrap

## ESLint

Standard linting for JavaScript

## Rewrap

Provides support for "hard wrapping" lines.

This is a must have whenever editing Markdown or authoring documentation in code
blocks.
